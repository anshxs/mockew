# 👋 Hey devs,

I’m tired of fake interviews, broken resume tools, and portfolios that take longer to build than the actual product.  
So I built **Mockew AI** – your full-stack career and creativity platform powered by AI.

## 🧪 What is Mockew AI?

A Swiss Army knife for developers. With tools that actually solve your everyday struggles:

- 🎙️ **AI Mock Interviewer Agent** – Realistic, adaptive interviews that feel like Big Tech loops  
- 🧵 **Debug Feed** – A dev-first social space to ask questions, share code, and get help fast  
- 📄 **Resume Builder** – Designed to help you stand out, not blend in  
- 🔗 **Linkdance** – Like Linktree, but for developers who ship things  
- 🤖 **Code Reviewer** – Instant feedback on your code with AI  
- 🧠 **Top 20 Product Ideas** – AI-curated startup ideas you can actually build  
- 🖼️ **Code to Image** – Turn your code snippets into beautiful images (great for social sharing)  
- 🪄 **Logo Maker** – Build your dev brand in minutes

🚀 Whether you're preparing for interviews, building in public, or just shipping cool stuff, **Mockew AI is your co-pilot**.
